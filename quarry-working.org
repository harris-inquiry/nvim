#+TITLE: Personal Customization for Nvim 



* Better Keybindings

** Quick tab navigation?
   + TODO Bit annoying that deleting current buffer of the tab 

** Toggle Completion
   Don't want completion in org files
   + really -> just don't want it *until requested*

** <leader> ff 
   for =fzf= current directory

** <C-i> doesn't go forward through jump history
   /What is it doing?/


* UI
** Need the "lightline" working
   Something for showing file data at bottom of screen



* Removing unecessary Plugins
