==Better Keybindings==

===Quick tab navigation?===
- DONE Bit annoying that deleting current buffer of the tab


===Toggle Completion===
Don't want completion in org files
- really -> just don't want it _until requested_


===<leader> ff===
for =fzf= current directory


===<C-i> doesn't go forward through jump history===
/What is it doing?/

- UI
  Need the "lightline" working
  Something for showing file data at bottom of screen

- Removing unecessary Plugins
